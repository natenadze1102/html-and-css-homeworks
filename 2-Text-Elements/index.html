In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.</p>

    <h2>January 14, 1997</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        <b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b> , as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML Working Group</b> on September 12, 1996.​<br/>
        Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <i>Netscape's blink</i> element and <i>Microsoft's</i>  marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
    </p>
    <p>
        A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
